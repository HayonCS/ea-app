/**
 * Provides a typesafe wrapper around `Bull` with some tooling to support
 * integration testing. A `JobSpec` is a value that represents a kind of
 * background job.
 *
 * The service layer typically uses `declare` and `processWithContext` to create `JobSpec` values
 * for operations that should be deferred until after an HTTP request and executed with retry semantics.
 *
 * These jobs are then registered with the `BullJobRunner`, which can be used to
 * `enqueue` a job, causing it to be run at a later time. The runner is also
 * responsible for setting up the `Bull` tasks in the worker process.
 *
 * In addition to type safety, this infrastructure also takes care of instantiating
 * a context for each job and providing dependencies.
